# Scaffold a new Ceramic app

Get up and running quickly with a basic ComposeDB application with one command.

**Prerequisites**

- Operating system: **Linux, Mac, or Windows** (only [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
- **Node.js v20** - If you are using a different version, please use `nvm` to install Node.js v20 for best results.
- **npm v10** - Installed automatically with NodeJS v20

You will also need to run a ceramic-one node in the background which provides Ceramic 
data network access. To set it up, follow the steps below:

:::note
The instructions below cover the steps for the MacOS-based systems. If you are running on a Linux-based system, you can find the 
instructions [here](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?tab=readme-ov-file#linux---debian-based-distributions).
:::

1. Install the component using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install ceramicnetwork/tap/ceramic-one
```

2. Start the `ceramic-one` using the following command:
```bash
ceramic-one daemon --network in-memory
```

:::note
By default, the command above will spin off a node which connects to a `in-memory`. You can change this behaviour by providing a `--network` flag and specifying a network of your choice. For example:

```ceramic-one daemon --network testnet-clay```

## Start the ComposeDB example app

You can easily create a simple ComposeDB starter project by using our CLI and running the following command:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'bun', value: 'bun'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```powershell
npx create-ceramic-app
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```powershell
pnpx create-ceramic-app
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

:::tip
You need at least yarn 2.x to use the `yarn dlx` command. If you have an older version, upgrade it by running `yarn set version stable` and `yarn install`.

Then you can run the following command to create a new Ceramic app using yarn 2.x
:::

```powershell
yarn dlx create-ceramic-app
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bun">

```powershell
bunx create-ceramic-app
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command will create a new directory with a basic ComposeDB application (a social app). It will clone the app from [repository](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/ComposeDbExampleApp.git), install all dependencies, launch a local Ceramic node, a local GraphQL server and start the app.

Once you have an opportunity to play with an example app and see how it works, you can start building your own app. For that, you will probably want to have more control over your environment and the code. You can find more information on how to set up your environment in the [Set up your environment](./set-up-your-environment) section.
