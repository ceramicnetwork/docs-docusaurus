# Running in the Cloud
Run a ComposeDB server in the cloud

## Things to Know
- This guide is focused on running in the cloud using Docker and Kubernetes. For local deployment instructions check out [Running Locally](../../guides/composedb-server/running-locally.mdx).
- Interacting with ComposeDB requires running a Ceramic node as an interface for Ceramic applications, `ceramic-one` binary for data network access, and a Postgres DB. Each of these components should be running within a separate Docker container.
- Docker images to run a Ceramic server are built from the [js-ceramic](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic) repository. Images built from the `main` branch are tagged with `latest`, the git commit hash of the code from which the image was built, and the npm package version of the corresponding [`@ceramicnetwork/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramicnetwork/cli) release.


## Cloud Requirements
**Supported Operating Systems**

- Linux

**Compute requirements**

You’ll need sufficient compute resources to power Ceramic, IPFS, and Postgres. Below are the recommended requirements:

- 4 vCPUs
- 8GB RAM

:::note

If you are just getting started with a brand new project, you can start with a smaller instance and scale afterwards.

## Running Ceramic server on Kubernetes

You can run Ceramic Server on Kubernetes on the cloud, such as [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) or [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).
You can also run Ceramic Server on [DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/).

Running Kubernetes on the Cloud means a provider will manage the underlying infrastructure for you. You can also run Kubernetes on your own infrastructure, but that is outside the scope of this guide.

### Running Ceramic server on DigitalOcean Kubernetes

DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) allows developers to deploy Kubernetes clusters using simple managed service.
Ceramic deployment on DigitalOcean Kubernetes will require 2 tools:

-  [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools) - the Kubernetes command line tool
- [doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) - the DigitalOcean command line tool

Make sure you have these tools installed on your machine before proceeding to the next step of this guide.

### Creating a Kubernetes Cluster
First, you will have to create your DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster. To do that, follow an [official DigitalOcean tutorial](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/create-clusters/). The process of setting up your Kubernetes cluster will take about 10 minutes.
Once it’s up and running, you are good to continue with the next step.

:::note

When it comes to choosing your cluster capacity, we recommend starting with the most cost-effective option - starting with the smallest cluster size and upgrading later. Also, keep in mind that
Digital Ocean offers free credits for the new users to start building their projects.

:::

### Connecting to Kubernetes cluster

First, you will have to configure the authentication of your cluster and retrieve the credentials. This can be achieved using the doctl command  below and substituting the authentication number provided
to you by Digital Ocean right after your cluster is launched:

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save 362dda8b-b555-4c47-9bf0-1a81cf58e0a8
```

After authenticating your cluster, it’s a good idea to verify the connectivity. This can be achieved using the following command which should list your cluster name, user and namespace:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

### Deploy a Ceramic node
In this section we will focus on deploying the Ceramic node on the DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster.

1. Clone the [simpledeploy](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/simpledeploy.git) repository and enter the created directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/simpledeploy.git
cd simpledeploy/k8s/base/ceramic-one
```

2. Run the following commands to deploy the stack:
```
# Create a namespace for the deployment
export CERAMIC_NAMESPACE=ceramic-one-0-17-0
kubectl create namespace ${CERAMIC_NAMESPACE}

# Create the necessary secrets
./scripts/create-secrets.sh

# Apply the deployment
kubectl apply -k .
```

3. It will take a few minutes for the deployment to pull the docker images and start the containers. You can watch the process with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods --watch --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0
```

You will know that your deployment is up and running when all of the processes have a status `Running` as follows:

```bash
NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ceramic-one-0  1/1     Running   0           77s
ceramic-one-1  1/1     Running   0           77s
js-ceramic-0   1/1     Running   0           77s
js-ceramic-1   1/1     Running   0           77s
postgres-0     1/1     Running   0           77s
```

Hit `^C` on your keyboard to exit this view.

:::note

You can easily access the logs of each of the containers by using the command below and configuring the container name. For example, to access the Ceramic node logs, you can run:

`kubectl logs --follow --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 js-ceramic-0`

:::


### Access the Ceramic node using the API

You can use local port forwarding to access the Ceramic node from your local machine. Open a new terminal and run the command below. The port forward will stop when the command is exited
so make sure to keep this command running for the rest of this guide.

```bash
kubectl port-forward --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 js-ceramic-0 7007:7007
```
Once you run the command you should see the following output in your terminal:

```bash
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:7007 -> 7007
Forwarding from [::1]:7007 -> 7007
```

:::note

The Ceramic node must be ready to accept connections before you can access it.
The pod's state must be `Running` and the `READY` column must be `1/1`.
You can check the status of the node by running the command below:

$ kubectl get pods --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 js-ceramic-0
NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
js-ceramic-0  1/1     Running   1 (28h ago)   28h

:::

To check the connection, open a new terminal and run the command below. A successful connection should utter a response `Alive!` as follows:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7007/api/v0/node/healthcheck
```

Expected output:
```bash
Alive!
```

### Expose the node endpoint to the internet

The last step is to expose your Ceramic node to the internet so that it’s accessible for your application. This can be done using a DigitalOcean Load Balancer which comes pre-configured for using using the SimpleDeploy scripts. 
You can get the EXTERNAM IP of your `js-ceramic node` (as well as `ceramic-one`) using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 js-ceramic-lb-0
```

The result of this command will be an output similar to the one below. Keep in mind that might take a few minutes for the EXTERMAL-IP to be configured and change the status from `<pending>`:

```bash
NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)          AGE
js-ceramic-lb-1   LoadBalancer   10.245.10.130   174.138.109.159   7007:31284/TCP   4m4s
```

This external IP address can now be used for accessing your node. To test it out, copy the external IP address provided above and substitute it in the following health check command:

```bash
curl http://174.138.109.159:7007/api/v0/node/healthcheck
```

Once again, a successful connection will provide an output `Alive!`:
```bash
Alive!
```

### Optional - Add an SSL Cert and Domain Name
If you wish to direct a domain to your ceramic node and acquire an SSL Certificate, you may follow the steps under [cert-ingress](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/simpledeploy/blob/main/k8s/cert-ingress/README.md) to modify the kubernetes setup.  Of course you may use other methods to add a domain name and certificate depending on what provider you wish to use.

### Utilize the Deployed Assets with ComposeDB CLI and Graphiql Server
Now that you have a Ceramic server deployed, you can utilize the [ComposeDB Cli](../../set-up-your-environment.mdx#composedb) to create models and
composites, as well as standing up a Graphiql server backed by the Ceramic with ComposeDB server.

First you will need to install [ComposeDB Cli](../../set-up-your-environment.mdx#composedb). Next you will need to setup,
your environment to properly talk to your server

```bash
export CERAMIC_URL="http://"$(kubectl get service js-ceramic-lb-0 --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 -o json | jq -r '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip')":7007"
export DID_PRIVATE_KEY=$(kubectl get secrets --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 ceramic-admin -o json | jq -r '.data."private-key"' | base64 -d)
```

You can now follow the existing guides, adding `--ceramic-url` or `--did-private-key` to your composdb calls. For
example:

```bash
composedb composite:from-model kjzl6hvfrbw6c5ajfmes842lu09vjxu5956e3xq0xk12gp2jcf9s90cagt2god9 --output=my-first-composite-single.json --ceramic-url=$CERAMIC_URL --did-private-key=$DID_PRIVATE_KEY
```

will create a new composite, utilizing your remote Ceramic server. You can also run Graphiql locally

```bash
composedb graphql:server --graphiql runtime-composite.json --port=5005 --did-private-key=$DID_PRIVATE_KEY
```

You can access the graphiql server at [http://localhost:5005/graphql](http://localhost:5005/graphql)

## Commonly asked questions

### Where is my data stored?

Each part of the stack (js-ceramic, postgres) has its own [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).
You can view the volumes with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get PersistentVolumeClaim --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0
```

This output includes identifiers for the volume on the cloud provider as well as the size and storage class, which defines the properties of the volume.

### What is my admin DID and how do I use it to connect?
The ceramic node is configured with an admin DID. This DID is used to authenticate with the ceramic node. The DID is derived from a seed, which is stored in a kubernetes secret named ceramic-admin and the private-key key's value is the base64 encoded seed.

While the example deployment creates a random seed for the admin DID, you can use your own seed by creating a secret with the same name and key instead of using the create-secrets.sh script.

Example:
```
$ kubectl create secret generic ceramic-admin --from-literal=private-key=<YOUR SEED>
```
To view the currently configured admin DID seed, you can use the following command (requires jq):
```
kubectl get secrets --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 ceramic-admin -o json | jq -r '.data."private-key"' | base64 -d
```

### How do I connect to the Postgres database?

You can create a session to the postgres database with the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 -ti postgres-0 -- psql -U ceramic
```

A `postgres` service is also created and can be exposed locally with port-forwarding:

```bash
kubectl port-forward --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 svc/postgres 5432
```

The `ceramic` user password randomly generated during deployment.
It is also available in the `postgres-auth` secret:

```bash
kubectl --namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0 get secrets postgres-auth -o yaml
```

Here you should get the following output:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: NzNjNzQ4ZDkxM2Y5NGQ2MmQwOTRiYzQ2YzIzMmM4YzdlYzFhODA2MA==
  username: Y2VyYW1pYw==
kind: Secret
...
```

### How do I shut it all down?

To remove the workload from the cluster, you can delete the namespace. For example:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace ceramic-one-0-17-0
```


## Docker Hub
You can find the ComposeDB server and IPFS Docker images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ceramicnetwork).
Below, you can find examples of how you can run IPFS, Postgres and Ceramic processes using Docker.


### Running Postgres
An example below demonstrates how you can run a Postgres process. Make sure to update the variables to fit your use case:

```bash
docker pull postgres

docker run -d \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
  -v /path_on_volume_for_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  --name postgres \
  postgres
```

You can also follow the examples from the official Postgres Docker image [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

### Running Ceramic
An example below demonstrates how you can run a Ceramic server using Docker. Make sure to update the variables to fit your use case:

```bash
docker pull ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic:latest

docker run -d \
  -p 7007:7007 \
  -v /path_on_volume_for_daemon_config:/root/.ceramic/daemon.config.json \
  -v /path_on_volume_for_ceramic_logs:/root/.ceramic/logs \
  -v /path_on_volume_for_ceramic_statestore:/root/.ceramic/statestore \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e CERAMIC_INDEXING_DB_URI=postgres://username:password@host:5432/dbname \
  --name ceramic \
  js-ceramic --ipfs-api http://ipfs_ip_address:5101
```

### Editing the `daemon.config.json` file

To have the settings persist in your Ceramic node, edit the `daemon.config.json` file to include the configurations. The default location is `~/.ceramic/daemon.config.json`. For a full file example, see the [Ceramic](../../../protocol/js-ceramic/guides/ceramic-nodes/running-cloud#example-daemonconfigjson) docs.

```bash
...
    "ipfs": {
        "mode": "remote",
        "host": "http://ipfs_ip_address:5101"
    },
...
```

```bash
...
"indexing": {
    "db": "postgres://username:password@host:5432/dbname",
    "allow-queries-before-historical-sync": true,
    "enable-historical-sync": false
  }
...
```

## Next Steps

- Understand the different ways to [configure your server](../../guides/composedb-server/server-configurations.mdx), including choosing a network
- Use your Admin DID to authenticate your node to gain [access to mainnet](../../guides/composedb-server/access-mainnet.mdx)
