# Interact with data
The final step of getting started with ComposeDB is interacting with your data using GraphQL. In this guide you will learn how to perform GraphQL queries and mutations using your composite.

:::

## Setup
### GraphQL Server
To interact with data on the network, start a local GraphQL server by running the command below. Note that you have to provide the [private key](./set-up-your-environment#generate-your-private-key) to your `did-private-key` here ‚Äî it is also required for performing mutations, covered below.

```bash
composedb graphql:server --ceramic-url=http://localhost:7007 --graphiql runtime-composite.json --did-private-key=your-private-key --port=5005
```

>‚úèÔ∏è ***Note:*** You can customize the port by configuring the `‚Äî-port` flag.


The output will display a URL, for example:
```bash
GraphQL server is listening on http://localhost:5005/graphql
```

### GraphQL Web UI
In your browser, visit the URL that your local GraphQL server is listening on. You will see a simple UI that you can use to easily interact with your data.
This UI allows you to run queries by simply writing data queries inside of the editor you see below and pressing the "Play" button to see the results of the query:

## Queries
One of the most common data interactions you might want to do with ComposeDB is read records from the graph. Using GraphQL, you can query ComposeDB records indexed by your Ceramic node.

In the [Create your composite](./create-your-composite.mdx) guide, we fetched two models from the Catalog: `Post` and `SimpleProfile`. Here we will focus on `Post` model. For example, let‚Äôs say you want to check the first 2 entries that were indexed on the Post graph. This can be achieved running a query like below and specifying that you want to retrieve first 2 records:

  

**Query**:

  

```graphql
query{
  postsIndex(first: 2) {
    edges {
      node {
        body
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  

You should see a response similar to the one below. Here, nodes correspond to stored documents while edges represent the relations between nodes.

  

**Response**:

  

```json
{
  "data": {
    "postsIndex": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "text": "A Post created using composites and GraphQL"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "text": "This is my second post!"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

  

You have options to retrieve specific records or last `n` indexed records as well. For example, to check the last 3 records, run the query below:

  

**Query:**

  

```graphql
query{
  postsIndex(last: 3) {
    edges {
      node {
        body
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  

## Mutations
There are three types of mutations you can perform on ComposeDB data: creating, and updating records, or change wether the records is indexed or not.
  
### Creating records
Let‚Äôs say, you would like to create a post and add it to the graph. To do that, you will have to run a mutation as shown below and pass the actual text as a variable:

  

**Query:**

  

```graphql
mutation CreateNewPost($i: CreatePostsInput!){
  createPosts(input: $i){
    document{
      id
      title
      body
      tag
      ranking
      created_at
    }
  }
}
```

  

**Variables:**

  

```json
{
  "i": {
    "content": {
      "title": "New post",
      "body": "My new post on Ceramic",
      "tag": "User post",
      "ranking": 5,
      "created_at": "2024-12-03T10:15:30Z"
    }
  }
}
```

  

The result of the query above will be a new document with a unique ID and the content you provided:

  

**Response**:

  

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createPosts": {
      "document": {
        "id": "kjzl6kcym7w8y5ygh1fyvstbjztd69suybc4ez8bet2hun7jezrc2m0uwg5bm3q",
        "title": "New post",
        "body": "My new post on Ceramic",
        "tag": "User post",
        "ranking": 5,
        "created_at": "2024-12-03T10:15:30Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  
:::note

Stream IDs are unique. The ‚Äúid‚Äù you will see in the response when performing the mutation above will be different. Keep that in mind
as you follow this guide and update the id to the one that you see in your response.

:::
  

### Updating records
Now let‚Äôs say you want to edit the post you created in the previous step. To update it, you have to run the `UpdatePost` mutation and pass the post‚Äôs unique ID along with the updated content as variables.

:::info

You can find your post‚Äôs ID in the response after you ran the `CreateNewPost` mutation.

:::
  

**Query:**

```graphql
mutation UpdatePost($i: UpdatePostsInput!) {
    updatePosts(input: $i) {
        document {
            id
            title
            body
            tag
            ranking
            created_at
        }
    }
}
```

  

**Variables:**

```json
{
  "i": {
    "id": "kjzl6kcym7w8y5ygh1fyvstbjztd69suybc4ez8bet2hun7jezrc2m0uwg5bm3q",
    "content": {
      "title": "New post",
      "body": "My new post on Ceramic using ComposeDB",
      "tag": "User post",
      "ranking": 5,
      "created_at": "2024-12-03T10:15:30Z"
    }
  }
}
```

This mutation will update the record with ID `kjzl6kcym7w8y5ygh1fyvstbjztd69suybc4ez8bet2hun7jezrc2m0uwg5bm3q`.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "updatePosts": {
      "document": {
        "id": "kjzl6kcym7w8y5ygh1fyvstbjztd69suybc4ez8bet2hun7jezrc2m0uwg5bm3q",
        "title": "New post",
        "body": "My new post on Ceramic using ComposeDB",
        "tag": "User post",
        "ranking": 5,
        "created_at": "2024-12-03T10:15:30Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Remove/Restore record from index
If instead of updating the created post record we want to stop indexing said record we would need to  use the `enableIndexingPost`
mutation with the `shouldIndex` option set to `false`, or if we want to index an un-indexed record we can call the `enableIndexingPost`
mutation with the `shouldIndex` option set to `true`, and the post ID as variable.
  

**Query:**

```graphql
mutation EnableIndexingPost($i: EnableIndexingPostsInput!) {
      enableIndexingPosts(input: $i) {
          document {
            id
          }
        }
      }
```

  

**Variables:**

```json
{
  "i": {
    "id": "kjzl6kcym7w8y5ygh1fyvstbjztd69suybc4ez8bet2hun7jezrc2m0uwg5bm3q",
    "shouldIndex": false
  }
}
```

This mutation will un-index the record with ID `kjzl6kcym7w8y5ygh1fyvstbjztd69suybc4ez8bet2hun7jezrc2m0uwg5bm3q`.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "enableIndexingPosts": {
      "document": null
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication
Although you can query records created by other accounts, you can only perform mutations on records controlled by your account. This guide did not require your authentication because you previously did that in the [Set up your environment](./set-up-your-environment.mdx) guide.

üîë `did-private-key` plays a very important role for these kind of mutations - it ensures that only you, the account owner, can make changes to the streams that you created.
