# Quickstart

The first step to build with ComposeDB is setting up your development environment. This Quickstart guide will walk you through the process of setting up your local development environment from scratch.

By the end of this guide you'll have a good understanding of how to get started building with ComposeDB.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Operating system: **Linux, Mac, or Windows** (only [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
- **Node.js v20** - If you are using a different version, please use `nvm` to install Node.js v20 for best results.
- **npm v10** - Installed automatically with NodeJS v20

## 2. Installation

There are a few ways to set up your environment. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

- [Using `create-ceramic-app`](#installation-using-create-ceramic-app) - get up and running quickly with a basic ComposeDB application with one command. Good for the first quick experience with Ceramic and ComposeDB.
- [Using the Wheel](#installation-using-wheel) - the recommended and the easiest way to configure your full working environment and install the necessary dependencies.
- [Using JavaScript package managers](#installation-using-javascript-package-managers) - an alternative, more manual, way to configure your working environment which supports `npm`, `pnpm` and `yarn`.

**Install and start the `ceramic-one` binary**

All of the configuration options listed above **require a `ceramic-one` binary up and running**, which provides a data network access. You can run `ceramic-one` on your
local machine using two simple steps listed below.

:::note
The instructions below cover the steps for the MacOS-based systems. If you are running on a Linux-based system, you can find the 
instructions [here](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?tab=readme-ov-file#linux---debian-based-distributions).
:::

1. Install the component using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install ceramicnetwork/tap/ceramic-one
```

2. Start the `ceramic-one` using the following command:
```bash
ceramic-one daemon 
```

:::note
By default, the command above will spin off a node which connects to a `testnet-clay` network. You can change this behaviour by providing a `--network` flag and specifying a network of your choice. For example:

```ceramic-one daemon --network testnet-clay```
:::


By default `ceramic-one` will store its data in the current directory. You can configure this behaviour by 
specifying the `--store-dir`and `--p2p-key-dir` arguments. For example:

```bash
ceramic-one daemon --store-dir ~/.ceramic-one --p2p-key-dir ~/.ceramic-one
```


With `ceramic-one` binary up and running you can move on with the ComposeDB installation and configuration method of your choice.

### 2a. Installation using create-ceramic-app

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>**When to use**</td>
    <td>When you want to get up and running quickly with a basic ComposeDB application with one command.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Time to install**</td>
    <td>Less than 2 minutes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Just run the command below and follow the instructions:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'bun', value: 'bun'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```powershell
npx create-ceramic-app
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```powershell
pnpx create-ceramic-app
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

:::tip
You need at least yarn 2.x to use the `yarn dlx` command. If you have an older version, upgrade it by running `yarn set version stable` and `yarn install`.

Then you can run the following command to create a new Ceramic app using yarn 2.x
:::

```powershell
yarn dlx create-ceramic-app
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bun">

```powershell
bunx create-ceramic-app
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2b. Installation using Wheel

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>**When to use**</td>
    <td>When you want to configure full working environment and start working on your own app.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Time to install**</td>
    <td>5 minutes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The easiest and recommended way to configure your full local development environment is by using [Wheel](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/wheel.git) - a CLI starter tool for Ceramic that makes it easy to install necessary dependencies and run a Ceramic node enabled with ComposeDB. The installation instructions below are also covered in a video tutorial that you can follow:

<iframe width="660" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r68FXBTCBZ4?si=FRolthOjecS9Ys2_" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Install the dependencies

In order to use Wheel, you’ll have to install a few dependencies:

→ **Node.js**

If you don’t already have them installed, you will need to install at least:

- [**NodeJS v20**](https://nodejs.org/en/) - If you are using a different version, please use `nvm` to install Node.js v20 for best results.
- **npm v10** - Installed automatically with NodeJS v20.

Make sure you have the correct versions installed.

```powershell
node -v
npm -v
```

→ **jq**

`jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. The installation method depends on your operating system. Install it using one of the methods defined in
the [official tutorial here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

→ **PostgreSQL** (optional)

PostgreSQL is only required for a production configuration on the Mainnet. If you are new to ComposeDB on Ceramic and would like to quickly test it out, you can skip the PostgreSQL installation and come back to it once you are ready to scale your project. You will need Postgres installed on your machine to store indexed data.

To install Postgres, follow [instructions provided on official Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
Once installed, open Postgres in your command line:

```powershell
psql postgres
```

Configure your database using the following commands:

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE ceramic;
CREATE ROLE ceramic WITH PASSWORD 'password' LOGIN;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "ceramic" to ceramic;
```

#### Configure the development environment
Make sure you have the `ceramic-one` binary up and running. To do that, follow the steps listed [here](#2-installation).

Now you can use Wheel to install all of the dependencies needed to run Ceramic and ComposeDB as well as configure the working environment
for your project.

To download Wheel, run the command below:

```powershell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceramicstudio/wheel/main/wheel.sh | bash
```

Once Wheel is downloaded, you are good to start configuring your project working directory. To kick it off, run the command below:

```powershell
./wheel
```

Wheel will ask you a few questions, allowing you to configure your entire working environment - from what Ceramic dependencies you’d like to install to how your Ceramic node should be configured.

You can run the following command to learn more about available Wheel commands and options:

```powershell
./wheel --help
```

For developers who are completely new to Ceramic, we highly recommend starting the configuration with all the default options. This will install the Ceramic and ComposeDB dependencies and spin up a local node running `InMemory`.

At the end of configuration, this option will also give you an option to set up an example web3 social app for you to interact with and test ComposeDB features.

:::important

[Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS)](./guides/composedb-server/access-mainnet.mdx) is used to anchor Ceramic streams on a blockchain.
CAS is require for `dev`, `testnet-clay` and `mainnet` networks. Since `InMemory` option doesn’t use CAS, data generated for your project will not be persisted.

:::

If you are ready to dive into a more advanced configuration, head to [**Wheel reference**](../wheel/wheel-reference.mdx) page to learn more details about each parameter you can configure.

<!-- #### Interact with the example web3 social app

One of the easiest ways to get familiar with ComposeDB is through an actual example application
built using ComposeDB on Ceramic.

This application is a simple implementation of Web3 social application and comes with the following features:

- Sign-in using DID Key or your Ethereum wallet.
- Create your user profile
- Create a post
- See posts created by other users in the Explore section of the app
- Follow other users

Developers can use this application to easily test ComposeDB features, see example implementation or even use this application as a basis of their own
unique project.

##### Setting up

This application is set up by selecting `Include ComposeDB Sample Application` when following the Wheel setup.
At the very end of the Wheel prompt you will see the output similar to the one below. It means that the Ceramic node is up and running and that the example
app is accessible using the provided url:

```powershell
> demo@0.1.0 nextDev
> next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

Copy the provided url `http://localhost:3000` and open it in your browser. This will launch the example application
in your browser for you to interact with.

:::tip

The example application files are accessible in your working environment. You can navigate to the example app directory in your working environment as follows:
`cd ./ceramic-app/ceramic-app-app`

From here, you can make changes to any of the example application files and start the application manually by running the following commands:
`npm run nextDev`

:::

##### Interact with the application

Once your app is up and running you will be greeted with the following user interface:

![Data Model Table](/img/example-application-ui.png)

From now on you can interact with the application:

1. Authenticate using one of the provided methods:
   - [Key DID](../protocol/js-ceramic/accounts/decentralized-identifiers#key-did) - it's a simple authentication method that encodes public key into a DID string
   - [Ethereum DID PKH](../protocol/js-ceramic/accounts/decentralized-identifiers#pkh-did) - an authentication method which uses and Ethereum wallet (e.g. Metamask) to authenticate users
2. Create your account in the `Profile` section of the app
3. Create your first post in `Home` section of the app
4. See currently available posts in the `Explore` section of the app

  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

After you interact with the application you can dive deeper into the underlying application files which you can find in the directory of your app.
Familiarise yourself with the actual implementations of specific features, e.g. - check out the `composites` directory to see the implementation
of data models used for this application.

Check out [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r68FXBTCBZ4) for a more advanced explanations on how you can interact with this example app. -->

### 2c. Installation using JavaScript package managers

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>**When to use**</td>
    <td>When you want more control and a manual way to configure your working environment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Time to install**</td>
    <td>5-10 minutes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Another way to install the dependencies and configure Ceramic is using JavaScript package managers. This option requires more manual steps. The guide below covers this
process step-by-step. If you have followed the [Wheel installation](#installation-using-wheel) guide above, you can skip this section.

#### Install the dependencies

Start with creating the project directory. Here you’ll store all your app’s local files:

```powershell
mkdir my-project #creates a new directory
cd my-project #targets the created directory
```

→ **Node.js**

If you don’t already have them installed, you will need to install Node.js v20 and a package manager. We primarily use `pnpm`, but `npm` and `yarn` are supported as well.

- [**NodeJS v20**](https://nodejs.org/en/) - If you are using a different version, please use `nvm` to install Node.js v20 for best results.
- [**pnpm v10**](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Make sure you have the correct versions installed.

```powershell
node -v
pnpm -v
```

→ **ceramic-one**

Make sure you have the `ceramic-one` binary up and running. To do that, follow the steps listed [here](#2-installation).

→ **Ceramic**

ComposeDB runs on Ceramic, so you will need to run a Ceramic node. To get started, we recommend running a local Ceramic node. If you're interested in running the production node, you can follow one of the [guides here](./guides/composedb-server/).

Ceramic CLI provides a set of commands that make it easier to run and manage Ceramic nodes. Start by installing the Ceramic CLI:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pnpm"
  groupId="npm-or-pnpm-or-yarnr"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```powershell
npm install --location=global @ceramicnetwork/cli
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```powershell
pnpm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

:::caution

Global packages are only supported for yarn 2.x and older. For yarn 3.x and newer, use `yarn dlx` to run composedb cli commands

:::

```powershell
yarn global add @ceramicnetwork/cli
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

→ **ComposeDB**

Next install the ComposeDB CLI, which enables you to interact with ComposeDB data from your terminal:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pnpm"
  groupId="npm-or-pnpm-or-yarnr"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```powershell
npm install --location=global @composedb/cli
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```powershell
pnpm add -g @composedb/cli
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

:::caution

Global packages are only supported for yarn 2.x and older. For yarn 3.x and newer, use `yarn dlx` to run composedb cli commands

:::

```powershell
yarn global add @composedb/cli
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

The command above will install the latest version of the ComposeDB CLI. If you need to install a specific version, you
can specify it by adding `@version-number` at the end of this command. You can also prefix the version number with `^` to
install the latest patch. For example, if you'd like to install the latest patched version of ComposeDB 0.6.x you can run the command:

`npm install --location=global @composedb/cli@^0.6.x`

:::

ComposeDB provides two additional libraries that support development:

1. [@composedb/devtools](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.5.x/api/modules/devtools) containing utilities related to managing composites
2. [@composedb/devtools-node](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.5.x/api/modules/devtools_node) which contains utilities for interacting with the local file system and starting a local HTTP server.

To install the development packages, run:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pnpm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```powershell
npm install -D @composedb/devtools @composedb/devtools-node
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```powershell
pnpm add -D @composedb/devtools @composedb/devtools-node
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```powershell
yarn add -D @composedb/devtools@^0.5.0 @composedb/devtools-node@^0.5.0
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Setup

All dependencies are installed. Now you can start setting up your project. The first step is to run a local Ceramic node.

→ **Run a Ceramic node**

You can check that everything was installed correctly by spinning up a Ceramic node. Running the command below will start the Ceramic node in local mode and connect to Clay testnet.
Indexing is a key component of ComposeDB, which syncs data across nodes. Enable indexing by toggling:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pnpm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```powershell
npx @ceramicnetwork/cli daemon
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```powershell
pnpm dlx @ceramicnetwork/cli daemon
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```powershell
yarn dlx @ceramicnetwork/cli daemon
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see the following output in your terminal. This means you have successfully started a local node and connected to Clay testnet 🚀

```powershell
IMPORTANT: Ceramic API running on 0.0.0.0:7007
```

#### Developer Account

Now, that you have installed everything successfully and are able to run the node, let's create a developer account. You can stop
the node for now by using the keyboard combination `Control+C`.

→ **Generate your private key**

You will need a private key for authorizing ComposeDB CLI commands in the later stages of development. You can generate it using the command below:

```powershell
composedb did:generate-private-key
```

You should see the output similar to the one below. Keep in mind that the key generated for your will be unique and will different from the example shown below:

```bash
✔ Generating random private key... Done!
5c7d2fa8ebc488f2fe008e5ed1db7f1f95c203434bbcbeb703491c405f6f31f0
```

Copy and save this key securely for later use.

:::important

Store your private key securely - the key allows changes to be made to your app. In addition, you will need it throughout the app development process.

:::

→ **Generate your account**

Indexing is one of the key features of ComposeDB. In order to notify the Ceramic node which models have to be indexed, the ComposeDB tools have to interact with the restricted Admin API. Calling the API requires an authenticated Decentralized Identifier (DID) to be provided in the node configuration file. Create a DID by running the following command, using the private key generated previously instead of the placeholder variable `your-private-key`:

```powershell
composedb did:from-private-key your-private-key
```

You should see the output similar to the one below. Here again, the DID created for you will be unique and will differ from the one shown below:

```bash
✔ Creating DID... Done!
did:key:z6MkoDgemAx51v8w692aZRLPdwP6UPKj3EgUhBTvbL7hCwLu
```

This key will be used to configure your node in the later steps of this guide.

:::important

Copy this authenticated DID key and store it in a secure place, just like with your private key above. This DID key will have to be provided in your Ceramic node’s configuration file which will ensure that only authorized users can make changes to your application, e.g. deploy models on your Ceramic node.

:::

#### Using your account

The very first time you spin up a Ceramic node, a node configuration file is automatically created for you where you can configure how your node is operated. Here you have to provide the DID key which is authorised to interact with the Admin API.
The Ceramic node configuration file will be created inside of the automatically created directory `./ceramic` in your home directory (usually `/home/USERNAME/` on Linux or `/Users/USERNAME/` on Mac). This directory can be accessed using the following command:

```powershell
cd ~/.ceramic
```

Inside of this directory you should find the following files:

- `daemon.config.json` - your Ceramic node configuration file
- `statestore` - a local directory for [persisting the data](../protocol/js-ceramic/guides/ceramic-nodes/running-cloud#ceramic-state-store)

Open the `daemon.config.json` file using your preferred code editor and provide the authenticated DID, generated in the [generate your account](#generate-your-account) step of this guide, in the `admin-dids` section of the file as shown in the example below:

```json
{
  ...
  "http-api": {
    ...
    "admin-dids": ["did:key:z6MkoDgemAx51v8w692aZRLPdwP6UPKj3EgUhBTvbL7hCwLu"]
  },
  "indexing": {
    ...
    "allow-queries-before-historical-sync": true
  }
}
```

Save this file and start your Ceramic node again by following the steps in the [Confirmation](#confirmation) section of this guide.

#### Confirmation

As a final test, spin up the Ceramic local node:

```powershell
ceramic daemon --network=testnet-clay
```

Once again, you should see your local Ceramic node up and running as follows:

```powershell
IMPORTANT: Ceramic API running on 0.0.0.0:7007
```

By this point you should have your development environment and all configurations in place to get started working on your application.

Congratulations!

## 3. Frequently Asked Questions

Some questions and issues come up more often than others. We've compiled a list of the most common ones here.

<details>
  <summary>Which setup method is better: Wheel or JavaScript package managers?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p>**create-ceramic-app** is the fastest. Good for your first interaction with ComposeDB.</p>
      <p>
        **Wheel** is the recommended and the easiest way to configure your working environment and install all the
        necessary dependencies. We highly recommended going with Wheel if you are just starting out with Ceramic.
        Everything will be taken care of for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might consider using **JavaScript package managers** if you are already familiar with Ceramic and need more
        manual configuration and control over your working environment.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Which operating systems are supported?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      It's best to run Ceramic and ComposeDB on Linux or a Mac. You can also run it on Windows but you'll have to use
      WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). See the supported operating systems section at the top.
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Which Node.js version is preferred?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      We have seen the best results using Node.js v20. Earlier versions are no longer supported, later versions can
      cause issues for some users. While we're working on eliminating the issues, it's best to use Node v20 for now.
    </div>
  </div>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How long does it take to install the packages?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Installing everything (either with Wheel or JavaScript packages) takes usually between 2 and 10 minutes.
      Throughout the guide above you can find what kind of output you should be looking for to know that everything was
      installed correctly.
    </div>
  </div>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Where in the system do I run all of the commands?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Sometimes, especially when using JavaScript package managers to install Ceramic and ComposeDB, it's easy to forget
      that you need to run all of the commands in the app's directory. This directory is either automatically created
      for you when using Wheel, or you create it manually when using JavaScript package managers.
    </div>
    <div>
      When installing with JavaScript package managers you need to open 2-3 terminal windows and run different commands,
      so it's easy to miss that you can be in a wrong directory. Please make sure you run all the commands where they're
      supposed to run.
    </div>
  </div>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Where can I find a Ceramic node configuration file, daemon.config.json?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      When installing ComposeDB with JavaScript package managers, at some point you need to edit your Ceramic node
      config file. By default, it's in your home directory, in .ceramic folder (*not* in the app directory). It's easy
      to miss this detail so please check the path. This command should take you to the right directory: cd ~/.ceramic
    </div>
  </div>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How to restart a node after stopping it?</summary>
  <div>
    When you use Wheel to install Ceramic and ComposeDB, it takes care of the whole installation process. But please
    note that Wheel is just an installer, not a node launcher. If you want to launch Ceramic and ComposeDB again, after
    you have stopped it, you need to launch Ceramic daemon again and then launch ComposeDB.
  </div>
  <div>You can launch Ceramic daemon by running the following command: ceramic daeomn --network=InMemory</div>
  <div>You can launch ComposeDB by running the command: composedb</div>
  <div>
    More on all of the composedb command options can be found in "2. Create your composite" section of this Getting
    Started guide.
  </div>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How do I interact with the data once Ceramic node is running?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      The easiest way to interact with data is through a GraphQL Server. You can find all the details on how to set it
      up, launch, and interact with your data in section of this guide, "3. Interact with data"
