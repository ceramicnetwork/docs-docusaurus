## What is ComposeDB?

ComposeDB is a composable graph database built on Ceramic, designed for Web3 applications.

ComposeDB on Ceramic stores and manages data while delivering fast queries and a catalog of plug-and-play data models. Developers, data scientists, and architects use it as the graph data layer for Web3.

### Why ComposeDB?

- Store and query data with powerful, easy-to-use GraphQL APIs
- Build faster with a catalog of plug-and-play schemas
- Bootstrap content by plugging into a composable data ecosystem
- Deliver great UX with sign-in with Ethereum, Solana, and more
- Eliminate trust and guarantee data verifiability
- Scale your Web3 data infrastructure beyond L1 or L2 blockchains

### What are the Common Use Cases?

- **Decentralized identity** - user profiles, credentials, reputation systems
- **Web3 social** - social graphs, posts, reactions, comments, messages
- **DAO tools** - proposals, projects, tasks, votes, contribution graphs
- **Open information graphs** - DeSci graphs, knowledge graphs, discourse graphs

## How to Get Started

- [**See how it works**](./sandbox) - Explore the ComposeDB Sandbox, a web-based environment to interact with ComposeDB. Run some queries, interact with data, learn about the core concepts.
- [**Create your first Ceramic app**](./create-ceramic-app) - As easy as running `npx create-ceramic-app`, run your first local Ceramic app and start diving into code.
- [**Set up your environment**](./set-up-your-environment) - Learn how to set up your development environment to start building with ComposeDB. Experience the real Ceramic network, either on the testnet or mainnet.
- [**Create your composite**](./create-your-composite) - Learn how to create your first composite, a reusable data model that can be used across different applications.
- [**Interact with data**](./interact-with-data) - Learn how to interact with data in ComposeDB, from creating, reading, updating, and deleting data to running complex queries.
- [**Core ComposeDB concepts**](./core-concepts) - Learn about the core concepts of ComposeDB, such as composites, schemas, and queries.
