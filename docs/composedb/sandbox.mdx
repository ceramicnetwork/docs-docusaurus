# Sandbox

On this page, you can earn points for interacting with the Ceramic Network. Let's walk you through the potential actions you can perform while you learn!

<ConnectOnly />

Before we dive in, let's get you familiar with the GraphiQL interface. Start by pressing the pink play ▶️ icon in the component below:

<Sandbox queries='begin' />

<br />

You've performed your first query on a live ComposeDB node! Below are the data models the query provided for you is referencing:

```GraphQL
type Posts
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "tag" }]) {
    author: DID! @documentAccount 
    body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    tag: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    edited: DateTime
    created: DateTime!
    profileId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "BasicProfile")
    profile: BasicProfile! @relationDocument(property: "profileId")
}
```

 The query you performed essentially translates to *"give me the first 10 indexed instances of `Posts` and show me the id, body, tag, created, and author id field values from that model."*

 Easy, right? Let's introduce another model into the mix:

 ```GraphQL
 type BasicProfile @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "A basic Profile") {
  author: DID! @documentAccount 
  name: String! @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  username: String! @string(minLength: 5, maxLength: 255)
  description: String @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  gender: String @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  emoji: String @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 2)
}
 ```

 Here's a diagram to help you better visualize the relationships between a given user and instances of these two schemas:

 <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![sandbox diagram](/img/final-diagram.png)
</div>

Continue into the next section to experiment with queries that utilize this `BasicProfile` model.

### Reading Profiles

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `BasicProfile` model referenced above. Comments have been left for you above each query to help you understand what the query is requesting.


<Sandbox queries='profiles' />

<br />

You may have noticed that the fourth tab labeled "WithComments" references a new model we havent discussed yet. Below is the model definition for your reference:

```GraphQL
type Comments
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A comment on a post")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }]) {
    comment: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    edited: DateTime
    created: DateTime!
    profileId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "BasicProfile")
    profile: BasicProfile! @relationDocument(property: "profileId")
    postId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "Posts")
    post: Posts! @relationDocument(property: "postId")
}
```

We've also defined a field within our `BasicProfile` model that exposes the relationship between a `BasicProfile` instance and all `Posts` that they've created:

```GraphQL
type BasicProfile @loadModel(id: "$PROFILE_ID") {
    posts: [Posts] @relationFrom(model: "Posts", property: "profileId")
}
```

This is why you're able to access the first 5 `Posts` created by each `BasicProfile` in the "WithPosts" tab.

Finally, we've defined a similar field within our `Posts` definition that allows you to access all `Comments` corresponding to that post:

```GraphQL
type Posts @loadModel(id: "$POSTS_ID") {
    responses: [Comments] @relationFrom(model: "Comments", property: "postId")
}
```

You'll notice that the two sections below also leverage those features by calling on those relationships.

### Reading Posts

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `Posts` model:



<Sandbox queries='posts' />

<br />

As mentioned in the previous section, several of the queries left for you ask for items in the `responses` field of `Posts` (which yields `Comments` corresponding to that `Posts` instance).

### Reading Comments

---

Finally, use the example queries below to access data related to the `Comments` model:


<Sandbox queries='comments' />


<br />

Great work! You now know how to query based on multiple relationship types, perform filtering and ordering, and even combine filters. Hopefully you've also created a few custom queries of your own to test out.

Now that you're familiar with reading data, let's learn how to perform mutations.

## Writing Data

---

#### Data Models

The following sandbox section will allow you to create Ceramic documents using a different type of query called `mutations`. For this section, you will be using a different model definition. These have been included for your reference below and have already been deployed onto the node this sandbox uses.

```GraphQL
enum Proficiency {
  Beginner
  Intermediate
  Advanced
  Expert
}

type Language {
  JavaScript: Proficiency
  Python: Proficiency
  Rust: Proficiency
  Java: Proficiency
  Swift: Proficiency
  Go: Proficiency
  Cpp: Proficiency
  Scala: Proficiency
  WebAssembly: Proficiency
  Solidity: Proficiency
  Other: Proficiency
}

type CeramicDev
  @createModel(
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["context"]
    description: "A Ceramic developer") {
  developer: DID! @documentAccount
  context: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
  languages: Language!
  attestations: [AttestToDev] @relationFrom(model: "AttestToDev", property: "attestedProfileId")
}

type AttestToDev @createModel(
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["attestedProfileId"]
    description: "Signals if user attests to another developer profile") {
  attester: DID! @documentAccount
  attestedProfileId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "CeramicDev")
  profile: CeramicDev! @relationDocument(property: "attestedProfileId")
  signal: Boolean!
}
```

You will use this model to self-describe your own development skills, and will therefore require you to alter the given examples to meet your actual abilities. 

You'll notice several unique qualities within the definitions above:

**Embedded "Language" Type**

Unlike the definitions used above in the read section, `CeramicDev` makes use of an embedded type called `Language`, which allows developers the ability to use these definitions in their data modeling as if it were a scalar. It's important to note that embedded types also introduce some restrictions - for example, developers impose filtering and ordering based on embedded types.

**Proficiency Enum**

Our embedded `Language` type uses an enum called `Proficiency` that restricts the possible values each key within `Language` can be assigned to. In our use case, we implemented a simple paradigm that uses a scale of 4 proficiency "levels."

**"SET" Account Relation**

Most importantly, you'll see that `SET` is used to define the relation between the authoring account and the model instance document. Unlike `LIST` (which allows an infinite number of model instance documents to be associated with a given account), `SET` lets developers restrict the number of instance documents to 1 based on the value of a subfield.

A simple way to understand this is to think about reviews on an eCommerce platform. If a customer has purchased a product, the platform should ensure that the customer can only leave 1 review for the product they have purchased. 

In `CeramicDev`, 

#### Authentication

You will first have to self-authenticate on the Ceramic node this sandbox environment uses. This is required for making mutation queries, whereas you do not have to be authenticated on a given node to read its data. In order to do so, you will need the MetaMask wallet browser extension installed.

Once you're ready, go ahead and press the `Authenticate on Ceramic` button below, and sign the messages within the MetaMask popups.

<div style={{height: "100%", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><Connect /></div>

Your browser wallet should create a prompt for you that looks something like this:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Sign in prompt](/img/sign-in.png)
</div>

Notice how there's 1 model listed under "Resources" in the prompt - the model listed here is the StreamID of the `CeramicDev` model definition shown above that has already been deployed onto Ceramic. By signing this prompt, you are creating a temporary session that allows the current application to create edits on your behalf _only_ to the resources you've granted access to (in this case, our `CeramicDev` schema).

### Creating a Record

Now that you're authenticated, you'll be able to create a `CeramicDev` profile of your own! Be sure to adjust the dummy queries below to meet your unique skill set. You can edit the languages variable and the corresponding proficiency fields for each language that represents your own expertise.

For example, if you notice that a language like `Cpp` is missing from your mutation and you want to signal that you have `Intermediate` experience, you can create a new line withing your `languages` object and add `Cpp: Intermediate`.

<div style={{height: "60rem", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><MutationSandbox queries='mutations' /></div>

### Developer Feed

Below you'll see the most recent 8 `CeramicDev` records in addition to all verifications that have been issued in relation to that `CeramicDev` profile (these have been filtered to ensure each verification is from a unique profile):

<div style={{height: "100%", width: "100%", margin: "auto", marginBottom: "5%", display : 'flex', flexDirection: "row"}}>

<FeedExample />

</div>

### Write Data in a Local Environment

Notice how some of the profiles have obtained verifications? The ability to create an `AttestToDev` instance using this sandbox has been intentionally omitted from the runtime definition used on this page. We've done so to encourage developers to complete this sandbox module by following the steps below that allow you to verify your profile in a local environment.

To get started, clone the extension repository, install your dependencies, and run the local application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/sandbox-extension
cd sandbox-extension
npm install
npm run dev
```

The operations above will run the extension application in developer mode - go ahead and navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to start interacting with the application.

Once you have the extension running locally and visible in your browser, you'll be able to sign in using MetaMask. Be sure to use the same address and network you used when authenticating yourself on this page.

Click the `Sign in with MetaMask` button in the upper right-hand corner as the screenshot shows below to get started.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Sign in prompt](/img/sandbox-extension.png)
</div>

Once authenticated, you'll be able to verify your own profile as well as others. If you've signed in using the same account and network as the one you used on the sandbox page, you should see the profile you just created appended to the right:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![before verifying](/img/before-verify.png)
</div>

Notice how your profile does not currently have any unique verifications. You can go ahead and verify by clicking the `Verify Profile` button for that item. You should now see something like this:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![before verifying](/img/after-verify.png)
</div>

You can also verify profiles made by other developers that are appended to the left of your screen.

Finally, once you've verified your profile, return back to this page. You should now see your verification(s) counted for each unique verification you issued in your local environment back in the [Developer Feed](./sandbox/#developer-feed)

You've done it! You now know how to perform successful read and write queries on a live ComposeDB node!
