# Sandbox

Test out several pre-made example queries below to gain hands-on exposure to accessing documents by relations, filtering and ordering by fields, and combining query logic.

For a deeper dive into querying, visit the [**queries**](/docs/composedb/interact-with-data) page.

## Reading Data

---

#### Data Models

The schema definitions that this section of the sandbox uses are outlined in [**this repository**](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/ComposeDBExampleApp/tree/main/composites). The sandbox has been pre-populated with data corresponding to several fictionary people.

#### Instructions

To interact with the ComposeDB read-only Sandbox, simply press the pink play icon to execute the pre-written queries in the left-hand side of the embedded GraphiQL IDE. Results returned from your query will populate in the right-hand side of the interface.

You can also alter your query logic however you see fit, or build your own queries entirely from scratch based on the schema definitions.

### Reading Profiles

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `BasicProfile` model:



<Sandbox queries='profiles' />

<br />
---

### Reading Posts

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `Posts` model:



<Sandbox queries='posts' />

<br />
---

### Reading Comments

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `Comments` model:


<Sandbox queries='comments' />


<br />
---

## Writing Data

---

#### Data Models

The following sandbox section will allow you to create Ceramic documents using mutations. For this section, you will be using a different model definition. These have been included for your reference below and have already been deployed onto the node this sandbox uses.

```GraphQL
enum Proficiency {
  Beginner
  Intermediate
  Advanced
  Expert
}

type Language {
  JavaScript: Proficiency
  Python: Proficiency
  Rust: Proficiency
  Java: Proficiency
  Swift: Proficiency
  Go: Proficiency
  Cpp: Proficiency
  Scala: Proficiency
  WebAssembly: Proficiency
  Solidity: Proficiency
  Other: Proficiency
}

type CeramicDev
  @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "A Ceramic developer") {
  developer: DID! @documentAccount
  languages: Language!
}

type AttestToDev @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "Signals if user attests to another developer profile") {
  attester: DID! @documentAccount
  attestedProfileId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "CeramicDev")
  profile: CeramicDev! @relationDocument(property: "attestedProfileId")
  signal: Boolean!
}
```

You will use this model to self-describe your own development skills, and will therefore require you to alter the given examples to meet your actual abilities.

#### Authentication

You will first have to self-authenticate on the Ceramic node this sandbox environment uses. This is required for making mutation queries, whereas you do not have to be authenticated on a given node to read its data. In order to do so, you will need the MetaMask wallet browser extension installed.

Once you're ready, go ahead and press the `Connect` button below, and sign the messages within the two MetaMask popups.

<div style={{height: "100%", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><Connect /></div>

Your browser wallet should create a prompt for you that looks something like this:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Sign in prompt](/img/sign-in.png)
</div>

Notice how there's 1 model listed under "Resources" in the prompt - the model listed here is the StreamID of the `CeramicDev` model definition shown above that has already been deployed onto Ceramic. By signing this prompt, you are creating a temporary session that allows the current application to create edits on your behalf _only_ to the resources you've granted access to (in this case, our `CeramicDev` schema).

### Creating a Record

Now that you're authenticated, you'll be able to create a `CeramicDev` profile of your own! Be sure to adjust the dummy queries below to meet your unique skill set. You can edit the languages variable and the corresponding proficiency fields for each language that represents your own expertise.

For example, if you notice that a language like `Cpp` is missing from your mutation and you want to signal that you have `Intermediate` experience, you can create a new line withing your `languages` object and add `Cpp: Intermediate`.

<div style={{height: "60rem", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><MutationSandbox queries='mutations' /></div>

### Developer Feed

Below you'll see the most recent 8 `CeramicDev` records in addition to all verifications that have been issued in relation to that `CeramicDev` profile (these have been filtered to ensure each verification is from a unique profile):

<div style={{height: "100%", width: "100%", margin: "auto", marginBottom: "5%", display : 'flex', flexDirection: "row"}}>


<FeedExample  />

</div>

### Attest to Your Profile in a Local Environment

Notice how some of the profiles have obtained attestations? The ability to create an `AttestToDev` instance using this has been intentionally omitted from the runtime definition used on this page. You can verify your own profile as well as others by cloning a local version of the application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/sandbox-extension
cd sandbox-extension
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once you have the application running locally, you'll be able to sign in using your browser wallet. Be sure to use the same address and network you used when authenticating yourself on this page.

Once authenticated, you'll be able to verify your own profile as well as others.

Finally, once you've verified your profile, return back to this page. You should now see your verification(s) counted for each unique verification you issued in your local environment.

You've done it! You now know how to perform successful read and write queries on a live ComposeDB node!
