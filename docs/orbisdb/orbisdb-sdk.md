# OrbisDB SDK

OrbisDB comes with an [OrbisDB SDK](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk) which makes it easy to create, manage and query open data.

OrbisDB SDK is a client-side complement to OrbisDB - a decentralized database built on top of Ceramic. It enables simple user authentication and provides necessary methods to manipulate the data.

Head to the [Orbis documentation](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk) to learn more and start interacting with OrbisDB SDK.
