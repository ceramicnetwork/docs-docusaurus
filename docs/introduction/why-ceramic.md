# Why Ceramic?

---

Ceramic is a distributed event sourcing and storage system that applications can use to store high volume user and application data, manage documents and content, and construct activity logs and databases. 
It adds trust to data at scale, offering faster, cheaper and higher throughput than a blockchain.

Ceramic's decentralized data network provides Web3 developers with a collection of features that make it possible to build scalable Web3 applications with composable data that can be reused and shared across applications.



## What Ceramic is for?

Ceramic enables organizations facing these common data challenges:
- Publish credentials, logs or other data without painful gas fees
- Manage rich user and behavioral data without compromising user privacy
- Store high-throughput machine data from sensors, agents, and network nodes
- Build new verifiable data products and pipelines on a battle-tested event sourcing system

## Key Benefits

---
### Speed and Scalability
Ceramic's data network infrastructure is highly-scalable and can service use cases where high amounts of data throughput is needed. On Ceramic, every data object maintains its own state and nodes independently process stream transactions, allowing unbounded parallelization. This enables Ceramic to operate at worldwide data scale, which is orders of magnitude greater than the scale needed for decentralized finance.


### Mutable data storage 
Ceramic provides developers with a set of standard, open APIs for storing, updating, and retrieving data from the network. This helps to break down data silos, enabling all data to be openly accessible. Additionally, all data mutations on Ceramic are cryptographically verifiable and can provide auditability throughout all historical versions of a piece of data that has changed over time.

### Data Composability

Data on Ceramic is structured and stored in data models, which can be easily reused by different applications to share data between them. Data models are created by developers in the community, and the ecosystem of data models is constantly expanding. Data models typically represent a single, logical application feature such as a user profile, a social graph, or a blog and developers typically combine multiple data models to create their application.

### Collaborative Developer Experience

Building composable applications with Web3 data on Ceramic is simple. Install Ceramic, browse available models, plug them into your app, and automatically get access to all data stored on the network that conforms to those data models. The community is constantly creating new tooling that make it easier to build, and expand what's possible with composable data.

### Sign in with Web3

Ceramic uses the decentralized identifier (DID) standard for user accounts, which are compatible with all blockchain wallets. When using Ceramic in your application, users can authenticate with the Web3 wallets they already have, and can even control the same Ceramic account from multiple different blockchain wallets (cross-chain) if they'd like. Data models are typically account-centric, meaning that every user is in control of their own data.

### Decentralization

The Ceramic network is decentralized and permissionless, allowing anyone in the world to spin up a node to provide storage, compute, and bandwidth resources to users and applications built on the network. Today there are no tokenized incentives for running Ceramic, but the community is exploring options.
