# OrbisDB

OrbisDB is a simple and efficient gateway for storing and managing open data on Ceramic.

OrbisDB provides a developer-friendly SQL interface to explore and query data on Ceramic as well as a user interface and plugin store to save development time on crypto-specific features â€“ from data migration and token gating mechanisms to automated blockchain interactions.

It is built on Ceramic's new Data Feed API which makes it fully compatible with [ComposeDB](./composedb-overview).
