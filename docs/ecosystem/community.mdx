## Ways to Contribute
### Ecosystem Grants
If you’re interested in a grant feel free to reach out in the #bounties channel. We welcome all submissions, but we’re especially looking for contributions in the following areas:

- **Marketplace GUI:** Wouldn’t it be great if developers could access the composite marketplace with an app UI instead of a terminal?
- **Sample Apps & Models:** Inspire other developers by building sample apps & data models, like reputation credentials, social apps, or DAO tools.
- **Easy Node Setup:** Make it easy to deploy ComposeDB on a node - we wrote a [proof of concept](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/ceramic-infra-poc) you can build on. Bonus: Terraform templates for cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and DigitalOcean.
- **Config Script:** We’d love to make [Set up your environment](../composedb/set-up-your-environment) even easier. Want to create a lightning fast script?

### **Open source contributions**
